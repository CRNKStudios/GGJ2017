# GGJ2017
Global Game Jam Vancouver Project 2017

## Coding Style
Please use the [Allman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style) 
Coding style conventions:
> Unity creates scripts this way
```
while (x == y) 
{
    something();
    somethingelse();
}
```
### Comments
Comments are important so we know what functions are. Try if you can to use XML 
style comments, however because we are in a time limited contest, just single 
line comments will work.
```
// This is a single line comment in C#
```
[C# XML Examples](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa288481%28v=vs.71%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396)
```
/// <summary>
/// Return string set true/false.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="s">String in the function</param>
/// <returns>True if set, else false</returns>
bool setString(string s) {
    return _s = s;
}
```
## Commiting
Please use the message to talk about what you fixed. Give a good broad overview 
of what you changed. Something more than just a sentace please so we know what 
was changed in the commit.
> Important: This is so if something breaks we have an idea where to look
## Problems
Talk to Spencer. He is Git Master for the GGJ and will handle issues if they 
arise
